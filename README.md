Time Series Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders using Keras in Python

This guide will show you how to build an Anomaly Detection model for Time Series data. You’ll learn how to use LSTMs and Autoencoders in Keras and TensorFlow 2. We’ll use the model to find anomalies in S&P 500 daily closing prices.
